NOTE:
- "Auto Cable" is the lightning bolt with an 'A'. It's fast but for exams, know the cable types.
- "Straight-Through" (solid line) connects different device types (PC to Switch, Switch to Router).
- "Crossover" (dashed line) connects
  similar device types (Switch to Switch, PC to PC, Router to Router).

PRACTICALS 1, 3, 5, 7, 9: NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
------------------------------------------------------

These steps cover Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, and Hybrid topologies.

---
A. Implement Star Topology
---
(Covers parts of 1, 7, 9)

1.  Devices:
    -   Drag 1 Switch (e.g., 2960) to the workspace.
    -   Drag 4 PCs to the workspace.
2.  Connections (Cabling):
    -   Select the "Copper Straight-Through" cable.
    -   Click PC1 -> FastEthernet0.
    -   Click Switch -> FastEthernet0/1.
    -   Repeat for other PCs, connecting them to ports 0/2, 0/3, 0/4 on the switch.
3.  IP Configuration:
    -   Click PC1 -> Desktop tab -> IP Configuration.
    -   Set IP Address: 192.168.1.1
    -   Set Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (it will auto-fill).
    -   Repeat for other PCs:
        -   PC2: 192.168.1.2
        -   PC3: 192.168.1.3
        -   PC4: 192.168.1.4
4.  Test:
    -   Click PC1 -> Desktop -> Command Prompt.
    -   Type: ping 192.168.1.2
    -   You should get a "Reply from..."

---
B. Implement Ring Topology
---
(Covers parts of 1, 3, 9)

1.  Devices:
    -   Drag 3 Switches (e.g., 2960).
    -   Drag 3 PCs.
2.  Connections (Cabling):
    -   Use "Copper Crossover" cables (or Auto cable) for Switch-to-Switch.
    -   Connect Switch1 (port 0/1) to Switch2 (port 0/1).
    -   Connect Switch2 (port 0/2) to Switch3 (port 0/1).
    -   Connect Switch3 (port 0/2) to Switch1 (port 0/2). This completes the ring.
    -   Use "Copper Straight-Through" cables to connect one PC to each switch (e.g., port 0/10).
3.  Observation:
    -   Wait 30-60 seconds. You will see one of the Switch-to-Switch port lights turn ORANGE.
    -   This is Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) preventing a broadcast storm (network loop).
4.  IP Configuration:
    -   Configure all 3 PCs to be on the same network:
        -   PC1: 192.168.1.1
        -   PC2: 192.168.1.2
        -   PC3: 192.168.1.3
        -   Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 for all.
5.  Test:
    -   From PC1, ping PC3 (ping 192.168.1.3).
    -   It will work. STP blocks a port but maintains connectivity.

---
C. Implement Bus Topology
---
(Covers parts of 3, 5, 9)

*Note: Packet Tracer doesn't easily simulate old coaxial bus. We create a "linear" or "daisy-chain" topology using switches, which is the modern equivalent.*

1.  Devices:
    -   Drag 3 Switches.
    -   Drag 4 PCs.
2.  Connections (Cabling):
    -   Use "Copper Crossover" to connect Switch1 to Switch2.
    -   Use "Copper Crossover" to connect Switch2 to Switch3. (This forms the "bus" backbone).
    -   Use "Copper Straight-Through" to connect PCs to the switches. (e.g., 2 PCs on Switch1, 2 on Switch3).
3.  IP Configuration:
    -   Assign all PCs IPs in the same network (e.g., 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, ...).
4.  Test:
    -   Ping from a PC on Switch1 to a PC on Switch3. It will work.

---
D. Implement Mesh Topology
---
(Covers part of 7)

1.  Devices:
    -   Drag 4 Switches.
2.  Connections (Cabling):
    -   Use "Copper Crossover" cables.
    -   Connect *every* switch to *every other* switch.
        -   Switch1 -> Switch2, Switch3, Switch4
        -   Switch2 -> Switch3, Switch4
        -   Switch3 -> Switch4
3.  Observation:
    -   Wait for STP to converge. You will see MANY orange (blocked) ports to prevent loops, leaving only one active path between any two switches. This shows high redundancy.
4.  Test:
    -   Connect a PC to each switch, configure IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.1 ... 1.4), and verify pings.

---
E. Implement Hybrid Topology
---
(Covers part of 5)

*A hybrid topology just combines two or more other topologies. A "Star-Bus" is the most common.*

1.  Build Topology A (Star):
    -   1 Switch (Switch_A) and 2 PCs (PC_A1, PC_A2).
    -   Connect PCs to Switch_A.
    -   IPs: 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11
2.  Build Topology B (Star):
    -   1 Switch (Switch_B) and 2 PCs (PC_B1, PC_B2).
    -   Connect PCs to Switch_B.
    -   IPs: 192.168.1.20, 192.168.1.21
3.  Combine (Bus):
    -   Use a "Copper Crossover" cable to connect Switch_A to Switch_B.
4.  Test:
    -   Ping from PC_A1 to PC_B1 (ping 192.168.1.20). It will work as they are all on the same 192.168.1.0 network.

------------------------------------------------------
PRACTICAL 2: INTERCONNECT TWO NETWORKS (ROUTER)
------------------------------------------------------

This is the most important practical. It shows how routers connect different networks.

1.  Build Network A (Star):
    -   Drag 1 Switch (Switch_A) and 1 PC (PC_A).
    -   Connect PC_A to Switch_A.
    -   Configure PC_A:
        -   IP Address: 192.168.1.10
        -   Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        -   Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (This is the router, which we will add next)

2.  Build Network B (Star):
    -   Drag 1 Switch (Switch_B) and 1 PC (PC_B).
    -   Connect PC_B to Switch_B.
    -   Configure PC_B:
        -   IP Address: 192.168.2.10
        -   Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        -   Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1

3.  Add the Router:
    -   Drag 1 Router (e.g., 2911) to the workspace.
    -   Use "Straight-Through" to connect Switch_A (port 0/1) to the Router (port GigabitEthernet0/0).
    -   Use "Straight-Through" to connect Switch_B (port 0/1) to the Router (port GigabitEthernet0/1).
    -   All port lights will be RED.

4.  Configure the Router:
    -   Click the Router.
    -   Go to the "Config" tab.
    -   On the left, select "GigabitEthernet0/0" (the connection to Network A).
        -   Set IP Address: 192.168.1.1
        -   Set Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        -   Check the "On" box for Port Status. The light will turn green.
    -   On the left, select "GigabitEthernet0/1" (the connection to Network B).
        -   Set IP Address: 192.168.2.1
        -   Set Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        -   Check the "On" box. The light will turn green.

5.  Test:
    -   Wait for all lights to be green.
    -   Click PC_A -> Desktop -> Command Prompt.
    -   Type: ping 192.168.2.10
    -   The first ping might "time out" (this is ARP), but the rest will be successful replies.

6.  Display Protocols (Simulation):
    -   Click the "Simulation" tab in the bottom-right corner.
    -   Repeat the ping from PC_A to PC_B.
    -   Click the "Auto Capture / Play" button (looks like a play button) to watch the packet.
    -   You will see an "ICMP" packet (the ping).
    -   Watch it go from PC_A -> Switch_A -> Router -> Switch_B -> PC_B.
    -   You may also see "ARP" packets, which are used to find MAC addresses.

------------------------------------------------------
PRACTICAL 8: IMPLEMENT MAIL (SMTP/POP3) AND WEB (HTTP) SERVER
------------------------------------------------------

1.  Devices:
    -   Drag 1 Server.
    -   Drag 1 Switch.
    -   Drag 2 PCs (PC1, PC2).
2.  Connections:

            -   Click "+".
            -   User: user2, Password: pass
            -   Click "+".
5.  Test HTTP (Web):
    -   Click PC1 -> Desktop -> Web Browser.
    -   In the URL bar, type the server's IP: 192.168.1.100
    -   Click "Go". You should see your "My CN Practical Server!" message.
